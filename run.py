 sage? Or maybe thyme?\nThe sensation\
 of falling jerks you awake, your eyes opening to a sea of stars as your\
 erratic heartbeat tries to stabilize.\nA sliver of a crescent moon\
 shines down on you like an unnatural, mocking grin.\nIts weak silvery\
 light glints off the edge of a rusted sword lying in the grass beside\
 you.\nYou sit up slowly, craning your neck to take in the\
 tall black hedges rising ominously on either side of you.\nAhead,\
 you see a large stone archway, weathered by time, leading the way deeper\
 into the darkness of the maze.\nAs you turn your head to look at what's\

 and you trip, your knees and hands breaking your fall awkwardly on the uneven\
 ground.\nAs you look back to see what tripped you, you stifle a gasp.\nA\
 skeleton in ragged clothing is staring at you with hollow eyesockets.\nIn\
 the pocket of its worn-away vest you see something emit an eerie\
 glow.\nYour hand reaches for it involuntarily, but you quickly jerk it back\
 when a shadow scuttles out from behind the skeleton.\nA spider as large as\
 your hand crawls up the poor man's remains.\nIt hesitates when it notices\
 you, its small head twisting as if puzzled by your presence.\nYou stare\
 at it in bafflement when it raises a hairy leg, almost as if in\
 greeting.\nBut before you can think it through a low growl emits from the\
 direction of the archway you just passed and the spider scurries away\
 through a medium-sized hole in the hedge you hadn't noticed earlier.\n")

 flames lift your feet off the ground making your world spin.\nYou barely\
 register that your arms aren't getting burned.\nWhen the roaring sound leaves\
 your ears, you slowly open your eyes again.\nYou're surrounded by a muddy\
 swamp, twinkling lights are luring you forward onto the overgrown path.\nAs\
 you take a step forward something heavy lands on your shoulder.\nYou jump\
 and quickly bat at yourself in a frantic attempt to get it off you.\nIt\
 lands on the ground by your feet and you immediately recognize the spider,\
 or maybe it's a different spider?\nThe creature raises both its front legs\
 in affront at your rough treatment, then casually makes its way through the\
 shallow mud on your left, away from the main path...\n")

 legs quiver and your feet feel like lead, you rush past the massive creature\
 as quickly as possible.\nThe blackened, steaming rocks soon give way to trees\
 which give way to a forest until the smell of pine surrounds you.\nSomething\
 rustles in the needles coating the forest floor and you tense up, only to\
 exhale in relief when a certain spider reveals itself to you yet again.\nYou\
 have the strangest urge to wave in greeting at the only creature you've\
 encountered so far that hasn't tried to kill you.\nThe spider hops, you'd\
 think he was happy to see you...\nBefore you can decide whether to pass by\
 him, he scurries off again to your left.\nThe moonlight up ahead seems to\
 indicate a glade of some sort, the open air inviting and perhaps leading to\
 an exit.\nBut you notice the spider stops and turns, almost as if checking\
 wether you're following him onto the darker path or not...\n")

 beautiful inari shrine\nDusting off your knees and pulling twigs and leaves\
 out of your clothes, you look up as you hear a strange sound.\nAt first you\
 think you might be hearing things, but when you hear it again it's\
 unmistakably the sound of a child crying.\nHaving no choice but to move\
 forward, you follow the torchlit path.\nAs the shrine comes fully into view\
 you notice a frail looking little girl, probably no older than six, hiding\
 her face in her hands as she sobs.\nHer hands are dirty but her kimono looks\
 clean.\nSomething in the girl's shadow draws your eyes, but the flickering\
 torchlight is fickle and dances this way and that.\nBefore you can scrutinize\
 it further the little girl hiccups and looks up as she notices\
 you.\nsniffling, she speaks in a barely audible voice:\n'hello'.\n")

 that of a snake.\nSo far, the being hasn't noticed you yet...\n")

 changes from grass, to sand, to gravel to rock.\nYou fervently\
 hope to find the exit just around the next corner.\nHeat surrounds you,\
 and when you round the corner, volcanic rock glows in the\
 darkness.\nNo exit seems in sight and you fear you've hit a dead end,\
 when suddenly the large rock blocking your path starts moving.\nTalons\
 the size of your arm, scales gleaming in the orange light and a huge\
 muscular tail which nearly sweeps you off balance.\nYour heart freezes\
 in your throat when eyes the size of your head open to observe you.\nThe\
 gigantic creature huffs out a puff of air so hot you fear your skin might\
 burn.\nThen the creature sniffs the air so strongly, you move an\
 involuntary step forward to keep your balance.\nFear slithers down your\
 spine and a shiver wracks your frame as you instinctively know that you\
 are facing an apex predator.\n")

 promise of an open glade seems to have vanished into thin air.\nThe\
 idea of ever finding a way out of this mess seems further and further\

 what to do next.\nThe sound of footsteps nears you, you look up\
 to see a woolly bipedal creature with long thin fingers and a horn on its\
 head.\nIn your haste to get away you stumble clumsily off the boulder and\
 fall backwards.\nIn a flash the creature is squatting on top of the boulder,\
 looking down on you with a mischievous grin.\n'Clumsy are we?, you\
 entered my forest, so now you must pay the tithe.\nI see the Fairies have\
 taken a liking to you, so for their sake I will not punish you for\
 trespassing without a test. Will you take my test human?'\n")

 you can breathe again.\nYour spider friend sits waiting for you amongst\
 an array of sweet smelling flowers.\nHe grows larger as you approach,\
 yet for some reason, you do not feel fear.\nBy the time you stand before\
 him, he stands slightly taller than yourself.\nHis head has morphed into\

 you.\n", "The girl's face morphs in anger and her voice takes on a\
 menacing timbre as she stalks towards you.\nHer form shimmering and\
 slowly changing shape.\n'You dare steal what is mine?'\nAs the girl\
 grows in size she simultaneously seems to become transparent.\nThe\
 last visible part of her are her slit eyes burning with a deep\
 hatred.\n'Despicable creature.'\nYou're rooted to the spot as she lunges\
 towards you in a formless kind of smoke.\nLifting your hands in a last\
 attempt at defense you scream in horror as you see the smoke force its\
 way beneath your fingernails...\n", "'Do you have it? Will you give it\
 back to me?'", "'Hm, you don't have it with you though...\nBut if you've\
 seen it, it must not be far. I suppose I'll track back in the direction\
 you came from.'\nThe girl's eyes suddenly take on a ruthless sheen.\n'I'm\
 afraid that means you are no longer of use to me human. No hard\
 feelings.'\n", "'No?' The girl sighs, suddenly all measure of sadness\

 offering?'\n", "The creature's gaze lights up.\n'where did you obtain thisss?\

 snack.'\n", "'Do not lie to me human! Were it not for the precious stone\
 you carry I would've eaten you for your insolence.\nGive it to me and I might\

 claps its hands.\n'Delightful!'\n before\
 you have the chance to do anything he already lifted you up by your arms and\
 placed you on your feet.\nHe regards your shoes in puzzlement for a moment,\
 but then shrugs and drags you into a spinning motion with one strong\
 jerk.\nYou could swear you hear faint music from somewhere accompanying your\
 awkward movements, but the creature hops around and seems utterly pleased\
 with himself, so you decide to focus on keeping things that way.\nSoon\
 however you grow dizzy and tired, you fall to your knees on the soft\
 pine bedding.\nThe creature regards you thoughtfully, then smiles.\n'I\
 suppose you'll be wanting to go home now? This is no place for a\
 human after all.\nThank you for the dance, child of man who received\
 the Fairies' blessing.'\n", "'The mischievous grin slowly turns\
 malicious.\n'You should not enter in games you are sure to lose\
 human.'\nThe last thing you see is the creature cracking its knuckles\
 before your sides seethe with a tickling sensation so fierce, all your\
 other senses seem to disappear and the world goes blank.\n", "The creature\
 cocks his head.\n'You tresspass in my forest, I offer you a chance at mercy,\
 yet you refuse?'\n'Tis a wonder how long your species has\
 survived.'\nScratching his hairy chin he regards you thoughtfully and then\
 shrugs.\n'Ah well, to each their own I guess.'\nHe reaches out to you,\
 you try to scramble away but he drags you back by your ankle.\nBefore\
 you can blink his long thin fingers have latched onto your sides and started\
 tickling you furiously.\nAt first you laugh and roll around.\nBut soon the\
 sensation becomes overwhelming.\nThe last thing you see through\
 tear-filled eyes is the manic grin of moonlight still shining down on you.\n"]

 I would like to introduce you to the mythical creatures you encountered\
 along your way.'\n", "'I understand, it has been a trying night for\

 motion, a wistful smile on his face.\n", "You startle awake, your head\
